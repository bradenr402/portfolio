I’ve never had a personal blog. It’s not that I’ve never wanted one—I’ve thought about starting one for a long time. I just never quite got around to it.

Until now.

This is the first post on my new blog: a blog post about starting a blog, on a blog that just started. What better way to kick things off?

Everything starts somewhere. This is the simplest possible beginning: an introductory post that exists primarily to remove the friction of publishing the next one.

I don’t have a grand vision for this space. I just want a place to share thoughts, ideas, and lessons I’ve learned. Sometimes that might include topics related to coding, design, or technology. Other times it might include parts of my life—or anything else that piques my interest. I’m not trying to force it into anything specific. I don’t have a schedule either. I’ll post when I have something to say.

I’m making this public because there are probably other people out there who are interested in the same things as I am. If that’s you, I hope you find something useful here. Or at least something interesting. If not, that’s okay too.

I’m writing for me.
